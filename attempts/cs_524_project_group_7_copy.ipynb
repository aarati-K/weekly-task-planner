    "As Graduate Students we are always dealing with quite a few tasks which need to be wrapped up. For ex- There are homeworks, research commitments, meetings, classes making it hard to get the complete picture of time allotment. What we end up working on is the closest deadline first task. A lot of time we tend to get some optional ad-hoc task, but because of non-clarity about our time constraints during the week, we sometimes end up overcommiting or undercommiting our availabilty. These problems inhibit our ability to properly plan our week. To solve this problem and get a more coherent picture of our week we propose a weekly task planner. \n",
    "### 1.A. Major Features \n",
    "* Each task is different and we would like to get a minimum dedicated window while doing that. For ex- A coding task is going to take 10 Hrs but we need a Minimum 2 Hrs window. The scheduler guarantees that we are allocated atleast the minimum window . \n",
    "* We can do a task for some Maximum amount of time, after that we need a break. For ex- For the coding task which needs 10 Hrs we can atmost work for 4 Hrs continously.The scheduler will only allocate maximum of 4 hrs continously.\n",
    "* Some tasks need to happen at a fixed time like classes, meetings etc. The scheduler will schedule them at that particular time.\n",
    "* Apart from that certain tasks are flexible, Like Research, we have need to spend some minimum hours and some maximum hours. Let's say 12 hours a week is the maximum but 10 Hours is the minumum. The scheduler will try to schedule at least 10 hours.\n",
    "* You can set whether you want take a break before starting the task.\n",
    "* The user can give weightage to whether he wants to work more hours or leave optional tasks unfulfilled. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the week we input our tasks and constraints as well as our preference, the planner will try to plan your weekly schedule and give the best possible solution trying to meet all the constraints. One interesting part of the planner is that let's say you add more tasks or some constraints like deadlines, instead of giving an infeasible solution we tell how much of extra work you will need to do during the week. This allows us to still schedule tasks and then user can choose how they want to reduce their work. To make the project more useful we output a csv file with the schedule, the CSV file can be directly imported into your Google Calendar, this will allow one to use the output of the project directly into their calendar"
